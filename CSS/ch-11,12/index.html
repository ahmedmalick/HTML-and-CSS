    <h2 id="cnc">Cloud Native Computing:</h2>
    <p class="para">The <span>Cloud Native Computing</span> program prepares the students to program in open 
        source technologies like, <strong><em>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, 
        React and React Native</em></strong> while introducing the students to development of 
        Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

    <h2 id="aic">Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p class="para">The <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the
        foundation of the AI technology, via teaching programming in open source
        languages like <strong><em>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</em></strong> and teaching 
        deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life 
        examples of modern day AI in practice</p>

    <h2 id="bcc">Blockchain:</h2>
    <p class="para">The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains 
        like <strong><em>Ethereum and Hyperledger(Fabric),</em></strong> and learn to program in languages 
        such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also 
        introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks 
        like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of Blockchain-as-a 
        service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) 
        of a crypto-token.</p>

    <h2 id="iot">Internet of Things:</h2>
    <p class="para">The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source 
        development technologies like <strong><em>Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel,
        Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</em></strong> while making them efficient in developing
        Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.</p>
